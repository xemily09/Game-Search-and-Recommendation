# Game-Search-and-Recommendation
Designed and built a full-stack web application for users to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations.

Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Used MySQL database on Amazon RDS to store data fetched from Twitch API.

Support register/login/logout and favorite collection.

Explored multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information from Twitch resources to implement a content-based algorithm.
